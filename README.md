## 🎮 Azura's Weighted Voting System

**Play the funding game where AI meets human judgment!**

Submit proposals for mental health projects, wellness initiatives, fitness programs, or educational resources. Azura AI reviews your proposal and assigns confidence levels that determine voting power:

### The Levels

<div align="center">

| Level | Token Allocation | Azura's Voting Weight | Admin Buy-In Needed |
|-------|------------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| 🚫 **Level 0** | 0% (Rejected) | No vote | N/A |
| ⭐ **Level 1** | 10% of pool | 10% weight | 40% needed |
| ⭐⭐ **Level 2** | 20% of pool | 20% weight | 30% needed |
| ⭐⭐⭐ **Level 3** | 30% of pool | 30% weight | 20% needed |
| ⭐⭐⭐⭐ **Level 4** | 40% of pool | 40% weight | 10% needed |

</div>

### The Game

```
🎯 Threshold: 50% of total voting power needed to pass

Example: Level 1 Proposal (10% allocation)
├─ Azura votes with 10% weight (low confidence)
├─ Needs 40% more from human admins
└─ High community buy-in required ✋

Example: Level 4 Proposal (40% allocation)
├─ Azura votes with 40% weight (high confidence)
├─ Needs only 10% more from human admins
└─ Low buy-in needed - Azura believes in it! 🚀
```

**How it works:**
1. 📝 Submit your proposal for mental health, wellness, fitness, or education
2. 🤖 Azura AI analyzes quality, impact, feasibility, and budget
3. ⚖️ Azura assigns confidence level (0-4) = voting weight
4. 👥 Admin community votes to reach 50% threshold
5. 💰 USDC transfers via Safe multisig when approved
6. 🎉 Your project gets funded!

> **Higher quality proposals = Higher Azura confidence = Less admin votes needed**
