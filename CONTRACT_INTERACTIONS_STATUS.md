## What You Need

To become eligible for OP Atlas Retro Funding, you need:

1. **998 more transactions** (total of 1,000)
2. **~418 more unique addresses** (total of 420)
3. **9 more active days** (total of 10 distinct days)

These requirements are measured over the **last 180 days** from when OP Atlas evaluates your application.

## How to Build Activity

### 1. User Interactions
- Encourage users to interact with your contracts
- Create proposals through the AzuraKillStreak contract
- Have users vote on proposals
- Transfer governance tokens to create more unique addresses

### 2. Automated Activity
- Run Azura AI agent to create and review proposals
- Set up automated voting mechanisms
- Create test transactions (but ensure they're legitimate use cases)

### 3. Community Engagement
- Promote your platform to get real users
- Run campaigns or events that drive contract interactions
- Integrate with other dApps to increase usage

### 4. Track Progress
Use the provided script to monitor your progress:
```bash
npm run check-interactions
```

**Note:** For accurate results, you'll need a BaseScan API key:
1. Get a free API key from https://basescan.org/apis
2. Add it to your `.env` file: `BASESCAN_API_KEY=your_key_here`

---

## Next Steps

1. **Continue building your platform** - Focus on getting real users and legitimate interactions
2. **Monitor activity** - Use the check script regularly to track progress
3. **Register on OP Atlas** - You can still register now, but eligibility will be evaluated based on activity
4. **Document your growth** - Keep track of milestones as you build toward the requirements

---

## Important Notes

- OP Atlas checks activity over the **last 180 days**, so you have time to build
- Focus on **legitimate use cases** - don't spam transactions just to meet numbers
- The requirements are automatically checked by OP Atlas when evaluating applications
- You can register on OP Atlas now and work toward meeting requirements
